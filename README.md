# GoTravel
Collaborative project done at Rutgers-New Brunswick Hackathon event, based on a travel agency concept.

Web Responsive Layout In this project, my team and I build a static destination website. They created the blueprint, used photoshop software, and I did the implementation. For this project, it took us at least 18 hours to make this program functional. This is not a finished product and there are still more improvements that need to be done for this project.

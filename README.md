(Still in Progress)

Live demo:  https://felixandrewsapalaran.github.io/HackRU2018Project-/

In this project my team and I build a static destination website.They created the blueprint, used photoshop software, and I did the implementation. For this project it took us atleast 18 hours to made this program functionable. This is not a finish product and there are still more improvements that needs to be done for this project.
